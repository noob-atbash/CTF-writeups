## SHAKEN

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION :

```
I love this watch. It's been with me all over the world, from Istanbul to Shanghai to Macau.I wear it with suits quite a lot. My boss liked it too. I remember wearing it when she died. What is her successor's name?

```

After reading the challenge description how the heck one can find watch wearing by dead person. It was quiety guessy like being an **OO7** fan  I cracked it it was just talking about James Bond  movie (a little research will also lead you to flag).  I just search 
successor of **M** in James Bond movie I got [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=successor+of+Judi+Dench+in+james+bond&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN849IN853&oq=successor+of+Judi+Dench+in+james+bond&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.946j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
