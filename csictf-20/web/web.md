## OREO 

This was a cookie problem as the website description was  :

```
My nephew is a fussy eater and is only willing to eat chocolate oreo. Any other flavour and he throws a tantrum.

```

### csictf{1ick_twi5t_dunk} 

by default the cookie was set strawberry(base64 encoded) you just need to change it chocolate in (base64 encoded)  form .

## MR. RAMI 

Quite peculiar *ques name* the website seems to be normal and nothing in the source code  but site content  was the hint **brobot** we need to see the sitemap using using **robots.txt**. 

```
 Hey there, you're not a robot, yet I see you sniffing through this file.
# SEO you later!
# Now get off my lawn.

Disallow: /fade/to/black

```

I got this on moving to /fade/to/black I got the flag
